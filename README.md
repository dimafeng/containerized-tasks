# Containerized-tasks

Gradle plugin that allows to launch tasks inside docker containers.

## Why do I need it?

I love java for its tools and reliability. But when you step on wind land of modern development
tools like `node.js` all what you love stops working.

For instance, you have a java project that has a part written in javascript, that means you
have to test, build, minimize, concatenate it. Of course, you can install node locally and it'll work
fine until you need to share your project with co-workers or even build your project on CI servers -
that's where the hell begins.

**This gradle plugin preserves consistency and immutability of the build environment.**

Now you can build your project on **different operating systems** with variety of configurations, but
get **the same result!**

## Setup

Build script snippet for use in all Gradle versions:

```
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.dimafeng:containerized-tasks:0.5.4"
  }
}

apply plugin: "com.dimafeng.containerizedTask"
```

Build script snippet for new, incubating, plugin mechanism introduced in Gradle 2.1:

```
plugins {
  id "com.dimafeng.containerizedTask" version "0.5.4"
}
```

## Requirements

* JDK >= 1.8

## Quick Start

Execution of node.js related environment:

```groovy
npmContainerizedTask {
    sourcesDir = 'src/clientSide'
    //imageName = 'monostream/nodejs-gulp-bower';
    //scriptBody = 'npm install\ngulp'
    //outputLevel = 'INFO' // 'ALL', 'DEBUG'
}
```
* sourcesDir - location of the folder with `package.json`
* imageName - docker image which the task will be executed in
* scriptBody - script that should be launched
* outputLevel - the level of logging which all container output will be going to. E.g. if it's set
to 'INFO' the output will be available with `-info` gradle option. 'ALL' is default.
